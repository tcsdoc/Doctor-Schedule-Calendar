## Current Status (v0.2.1) - ðŸŽ‰ XCODE WORKING!

### âœ… **Xcode Issue RESOLVED!** 
The Core Data model complexity was causing XML parsing crashes. Fixed by:
- Simplified relationships to use foreign keys (doctorID)
- Removed complex Core Data relationships that crashed Xcode
- Updated code to manually link doctors and appointments
- **Xcode now opens and runs successfully!**

Your app now includes:
- âœ… **Doctor Management**: Add, view, edit, and delete doctors
- âœ… **Appointment Management**: Create and manage appointments  
- âœ… **Tabbed Interface**: Separate views for doctors and appointments
- âœ… **Core Data Integration**: Simplified but functional data model
- âœ… **Sample Data**: Pre-populated data for testing
- âœ… **Working Xcode**: No more crashes, ready for development!

## Ready to Develop in Xcode! ðŸš€

### Build and Run Steps:
1. âœ… **Xcode is working** - Open `Doctor Schedule Calendar.xcodeproj` 
2. âœ… **Project loads successfully** - No more Core Data crashes
3. Select your target device (iOS Simulator or physical device)
4. Build and run (âŒ˜+R)
5. Test the following features:
   - Browse doctors in the Doctors tab
   - View upcoming appointments in the Appointments tab
   - Add new doctors and appointments
   - Navigate to detail views
   - Delete items using swipe or edit mode

### Current App Features:
- **Doctors Tab**: List of all doctors with specializations and appointment counts
- **Appointments Tab**: Upcoming appointments sorted by date with doctor names
- **Add Functionality**: Create new doctors and appointments
- **Detail Views**: Full information for doctors and appointments
- **Sample Data**: 3 doctors and 3 appointments for immediate testing
- **Stable Core Data**: No more relationship crashes, using foreign keys

## Next Steps for Development:
Since Xcode is now working, you can:
1. **Build and test on device** with your updated Apple Developer account
2. **Add Core Data relationships** back through Xcode's visual editor if desired
3. **Implement Phase 3 features** like calendar views and enhanced editing
4. **Deploy to TestFlight** for beta testing
