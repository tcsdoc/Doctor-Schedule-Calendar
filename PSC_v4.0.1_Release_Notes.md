# PSC v4.0.1 Release Notes
*Provider Schedule Calendar - App Store Submission Ready*

## ðŸŽ¯ Key Improvements in v4.0.1

### 1. **Fixed "Manage" Button Timing Issue**
- **Problem:** Tapping "Manage" button showed blank window on first tap, required second tap
- **Solution:** Implemented `onChange`-based sheet presentation with proper state management
- **Result:** "Manage" button now works consistently on first tap

### 2. **Enhanced Loading User Experience**
- **Problem:** Users found blank calendar during CloudKit loading "unnerving"
- **Solution:** Prominent, flashing "Loading from CloudKit..." indicator in header
- **Features:**
  - Larger, more prominent text and styling
  - Eye-catching pulsing/flashing animation (0.3-1.0 opacity)
  - Blue background highlight with rounded corners
  - Clear progress spinner
- **Result:** Much more reassuring loading experience

### 3. **Improved CloudKit Sharing Security**
- **Security Enhancement:** Changed default share permission from "Anyone with the link" to "Only people you invite"
- **Implementation:** Set `share.publicPermission = .none` in share creation
- **Result:** Medical data now secure by default, requiring explicit invitation

### 4. **Version Display Correction**
- **Fixed:** App now correctly displays "PSC v4.0.1" in UI header
- **Updated:** All project settings and Info.plist files to reflect v4.0.1

### 5. **Print System Stability**
- **Maintained:** Robust PDFKit-based printing with monochrome output
- **Features:** Dynamic week sizing, professional layout, month-per-page format
